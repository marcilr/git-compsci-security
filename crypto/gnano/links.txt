Python wrapper for nano for editing gpg encrypted files - very nice.
"I wrote a python script to solve this (for Linux only).
It works by decrypting the file into /dev/shm to ensure
that the unencrypted data is neva concern).to disk (although
it is possible for any of the programs using the data to be
swapped to disk; this is almost always a concern).

This has some benefits over some of the other posted answers:
o Only need to type the password once
o Works with any editor

The GNU Privacy Handbook
A symmetric cipher is a cipher that uses the same key for both encryption
and decryption.  Two parties communicating using a symmetric cipher must
agree on the key beforehand.  Once they agree, the sender encrypts a message
using the key, sends it to the receiver, and the receiver decrypts the
message using the key.
