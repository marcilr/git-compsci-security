disk-encryption-20130404.pdf
  This article discusses common techniques available in Arch Linux for cryptographically
  protecting a logical part of a storage disk (folder, partition, whole disk, ...), so that all
  data that is written to it is automatically encrypted, and decrypted on-the-fly when read again. 
  Very nice comparision table with Loop-AES, dm-crypt + LUKS, Truecrypt, eCryptfs, and EncFs.
  Both eCryptfs and EncFS support encrypted files.  eCryptfs is a kernel module while EncFS 
  supports non-root administration.
