# kerberos/        Kerberos is computer network authentication protocol which
#                  works on the basis of "tickets" to allow nodes communicating
#                  over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one
#                  another in a secure manner.  Its designers aimed primarily
#                  at a client-server model, and it provides mutual 
#                  authentication - both the user and the server verify each
#                  other's identity.

#                  distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around
#                  the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet
#                  connection from learning what sites you visit, and it
#                  prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical
#                  location.
