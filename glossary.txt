Glossary for encrypted filesystem


LUKS - is the Linux Unified Key Setup and is a standard format for linux hard disk encryption.
  It has a lot of interesting features such as using a key on a removable disk, keeping multiple
  keys, and more.  This is the technology used by the Debian Installer (since etch beta3) and is
  quickly becoming a standard in the linux world.
