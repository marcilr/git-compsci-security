Chapter 3.  Encrypted File System
3.1. Mounting a File System as Encrypted
3.2. Additional Information
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 now supports eCryptfs, a "pseudo-file system" which provides data and
filename encryption on a per-file basis.  The term "pseudo-file system" refers to the fact that
eCryptfs does not have an on-disk format; rather, it is a file system layer that resides on top of
an actual file system. The eCryptfs layer provides encryption capabilities.

Mount encrypted volumes in parallel
This is a simple change to rc.sysinit that allows mounting of your encypted volumes in parallel,
which can speed up boot immensely if you have more than one non-root encrypted partition.
