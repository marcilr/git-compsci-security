Security


Security items
==============
Following are items to improve security.

Any good auth system (according to Bruce Schneier ) should use two things from
the following list:

* Something you have. (Smartcard, token card)
* Something you know. (Pin, password)
* Something you are. (Biometrics, fingerprint iris scan etc

A smartcard + pin solution would be far better than a system that only used on
form of auth.   A smartcard can be stolen, but without the pin: no access.  A
password can be evesdropped,  but you'd need to swipe the card too.

The best security is a layered defense...

OpenSSH
=======
Use public-key authentication and disable password authentication for ssh.
You can sit back and laugh at brute-force SSH attacks, because they 
simply won't work.


* public keys ==> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on server.
* private key ==> ~/.ssh/id_dsa
  For better security the private key can be stored on a usb key.  
  This gets the private key entirely off the workstation.
  A symlink for ~/.ssh/id_dsa can be created pointer to 
  /media/marcilr/ssh/id_dsa under debian etch.  Then 
  ssh-add can be run to cache the ssh private key with the
  ssh-agent daemon.

packages:
  openssh-client - ssh and ssh-agent 
  openssh-server - sshd server

For configuration details see docs/debian/sshkey/README.

~/.buildprefs.properties
========================
The build preferences file has passwords so chmod 600.


Apache
======
Lock down apache to desired network access.

httpd.conf:159
<Directory "/usr/local/htdocs">
...
    # Access from localhost, UAA, and rockhounding.net
    Allow from 127.0.0.1 137.229. 69.178.10.210
</Directory>


Tomcat
======
Used by Tomcat management targets in projects.  Primarily to
reinstall warfiles.

TOMCAT_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml <=> ~/.buildprefs.properties

~/.buildprefs.properties:20
CALENDAR.INSTALL.URL=http://localhost:8080/manager
CALENDAR.INSTALL.USER=tomcat
CALENDAR.INSTALL.PASS=***

TrueCrypt
Free open-source disk encryption software for Windows 7/Vista/XP, Mac OS X,
and Linux.
o Only uses RAM for encrypting/decrypting.  Writes no unencrypted data to disk.
o Creates a virtual encrypted disk within a file and mounts it as a real disk.
o Encrypts an entire partition or storage device such as USB flash drive or
  hard drive.
o Encrypts a partition or drive where Windows is installed (pre-boot
  authentication).
o Encryption is automatic, real-time (on-the-fly) and transparent.
o Parallelization and pipelining allow data to be read and written as fast as
  if the drive was not encrypted.
o Encryption can be hardware-accelerated on modern processors.
o Provides plausible deniability, in case an adversary forces you to reveal
  the password:
Hidden volume (steganography) and hidden operating system.
